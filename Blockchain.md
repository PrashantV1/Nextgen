# Blockchain

Bitcoin,cryptocurrency all these are blockchain but these are only just a part of this massive technology like email is a part of internet .

In simple terms blockchain is a digital ledger that can not be tempered .It is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

Suppose there are 3 person A,B & C.
A wants to give C an amount of 1000 rupees using B as mediator.
Now A gives B 1000 rupees as 10 notes of 100.
B takes 2 notes of 100 rupees and replace them with fake notes .
B gives the complete amount to C .Now C founds that there are 2 fake notes and he complained to B and B said the same to A .Now A has to pay extra 200 rupees for the same transaction due to the fraud.

If the same transaction is done in blockchain then it will be impossible for B to fraud the transaction and if by any chance he is able to tempered the transaction then it will be recorded in the transaction .



## How Does a Blockchain Work?

The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).

Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes. 

For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.

Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair). As a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.

## Use Cases
USE CASE #1: A DIGITAL VEHICLE PASSPORT THROUGH BLOCKCHAIN
At the very latest when the car is being resold, questions like “What’s the mileage of this car? Has it been in an accident? Did the previous owner regularly take it to checked up on?” will come up. Until now, buyers couldn’t be completely certain of the answers.

Blockchain-based solutions like VerifyCar offer a cure for this problem. This app, currently being piloted, could enable users to track and verify the complete vehicle history, and share data – like the mileage – with third parties. It could even be used in conversation with the seller: “As a potential buyer, I could use the VerifyCar app on my phone to scan the QR code in the seller’s app,

However, the blockchain doesn’t only facilitate data transfer between private individuals. Car owners could, for example, also send verified data on the mileage of their car to a car insurance company in order to receive a discount for infrequent drivers. For security reasons, this has so far only been possible by accessing an isolated database. The decentralized blockchain could facilitate access to this information without compromising security.

USE CASE #2: SAFE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES
The key term here is “supply chain verification” – the tracking and documentation of supply chains. Both tasks are important not only for construction and spare parts, but also for materials.

Some raw materials like cobalt or wolframite come from sources that are difficult to monitor, like mines in developing countries. Many supply chains run through dozens of stations and middlemen. Such broad and diverging paths are susceptible to manipulation.

The first question is: How can we physically prevent a material from being replaced or mixed? This is done using traditional methods such as barcodes and seals – but also with innovative techniques like chemical tracers. These are chemical additives that are added to a batch of material to make it individually identifiable and machine-readable with a scanner.

The blockchain-based method offers many advantages to everyday business, such as easier certification and shorter customs procedures. For end users, the advantages of a blockchain-verified supply chain are obvious: better protection against counterfeit spare parts, for example, or a clear conscience regarding the raw materials used in a car.

USE CASE #3: CHARGE E-CARS 
Drivers of electric cars and plug-in hybrids (➜ Types of e-cars) will be familiar with this problem: You drive your vehicle to a charging station only to find that you don’t have the right kind of customer card because you’re not signed up to the right provider.

Blockchain promises to remedy this situation through a decentralized charging network and so-called smart contracts with electricity providers. Smart contracts are virtual contracts whose execution and compliance are guaranteed via a blockchain.
 Customers simply plug their vehicle into a charging station and don’t need to worry about anything else – not the provider, not identification (which currently requires a customer card), not the cheapest available charging tariff at that particular station. All of this is taken care of behind the scenes by a blockchain.

This is just a small glimpse of enormous blockchain technology potentials.
As we prepare to head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology it’s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. The next decades will prove to be an important period of growth for blockchain.
