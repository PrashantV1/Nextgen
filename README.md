# What Is Web 3.0 & Why It Matters

Where Web 2.0 was driven by the advent of mobile, social and cloud, Web 3.0 is built largely on three new layers of technological innovation: edge computing, decentralised data networks and artificial intelligence.

Web 3.0 is the upcoming third generation of the internet where websites and apps will be able to process information in a smart human-like way through technologies like machine learning (ML), Big Data, decentralized ledger technology (DLT), etc. Web 3.0 was originally called the Semantic Web by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, and was aimed at being a more autonomous, intelligent, and open internet.

So much for the technology but what difference will this make to the individuals and society as a whole? And how could this be even greater than the impact today’s applications have had on our families, businesses and governments? It has been said² that the characteristic which sets humankind apart is our ability to organise ourselves in the pursuit of a commonly envisioned goal. Thus it is highly instructive to cast our minds back in time / history, to identify four major social & technological stages in human collaboration



With Web 3.0, women, men, machines & businesses will be able to trade value, information & work with global counterparties they don’t know or yet explicitly trust, without an intermediary. The most important evolution enabled by Web3.0 is the minimisation of the trust required for coordination on a global scale. This marks a move towards trusting all constituents of a network implicitly rather than needing to trust each individual explicitly and/or seeking to achieve trust extrinsically.


## Roadmap 

HTML+CSS+JS-- Basic to design ,present and make the application working .

Typescript  -- Not only for type safety but for better productivity,debugging,static typing and easily bug spotting.

React/Next js  --React brings a lot of feature which are helpful to development in many ways and it is faster among many other frameworks because of its working prinicple .
With the default SSR there is next js(for mostly static and server side rendering)

Blockchain -- Not only bitcoin but is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible time line of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this time line. Each block in the chain is given an exact time stamp when it is added to the chain.

Ether.js/web3.js -- Library for interacting with ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem .
